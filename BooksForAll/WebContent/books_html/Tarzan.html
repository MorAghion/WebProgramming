Tarzan's First Love
</h3>

<p>
TEEKA, STRETCHED AT luxurious ease in the shade of the tropical forest,
presented, unquestionably, a most alluring picture of young, feminine
loveliness.  Or at least so thought Tarzan of the Apes, who squatted
upon a low-swinging branch in a near-by tree and looked down upon her.
</p>

<p>
Just to have seen him there, lolling upon the swaying bough of the
jungle-forest giant, his brown skin mottled by the brilliant equatorial
sunlight which percolated through the leafy canopy of green above him,
his clean-limbed body relaxed in graceful ease, his shapely head partly
turned in contemplative absorption and his intelligent, gray eyes
dreamily devouring the object of their devotion, you would have thought
him the reincarnation of some demigod of old.
</p>

<p>
You would not have guessed that in infancy he had suckled at the breast
of a hideous, hairy she-ape, nor that in all his conscious past since
his parents had passed away in the little cabin by the landlocked
harbor at the jungle's verge, he had known no other associates than the
sullen bulls and the snarling cows of the tribe of Kerchak, the great
ape.
</p>

<p>
Nor, could you have read the thoughts which passed through that active,
healthy brain, the longings and desires and aspirations which the sight
of Teeka inspired, would you have been any more inclined to give
credence to the reality of the origin of the ape-man. For, from his
thoughts alone, you could never have gleaned the truth—that he had
been born to a gentle English lady or that his sire had been an English
nobleman of time-honored lineage.
</p>

<p>
Lost to Tarzan of the Apes was the truth of his origin.  That he was
John Clayton, Lord Greystoke, with a seat in the House of Lords, he did
not know, nor, knowing, would have understood.
</p>

<p>
Yes, Teeka was indeed beautiful!
</p>

<p>
Of course Kala had been beautiful—one's mother is always that—but
Teeka was beautiful in a way all her own, an indescribable sort of way
which Tarzan was just beginning to sense in a rather vague and hazy
manner.
</p>

<p>
For years had Tarzan and Teeka been play-fellows, and Teeka still
continued to be playful while the young bulls of her own age were
rapidly becoming surly and morose.  Tarzan, if he gave the matter much
thought at all, probably reasoned that his growing attachment for the
young female could be easily accounted for by the fact that of the
former playmates she and he alone retained any desire to frolic as of
old.
</p>

<p>
But today, as he sat gazing upon her, he found himself noting the
beauties of Teeka's form and features—something he never had done
before, since none of them had aught to do with Teeka's ability to race
nimbly through the lower terraces of the forest in the primitive games
of tag and hide-and-go-seek which Tarzan's fertile brain evolved.
Tarzan scratched his head, running his fingers deep into the shock of
black hair which framed his shapely, boyish face—he scratched his head
and sighed.  Teeka's new-found beauty became as suddenly his despair.
He envied her the handsome coat of hair which covered her body.  His
own smooth, brown hide he hated with a hatred born of disgust and
contempt.  Years back he had harbored a hope that some day he, too,
would be clothed in hair as were all his brothers and sisters; but of
late he had been forced to abandon the delectable dream.
</p>

<p>
Then there were Teeka's great teeth, not so large as the males, of
course, but still mighty, handsome things by comparison with Tarzan's
feeble white ones.  And her beetling brows, and broad, flat nose, and
her mouth! Tarzan had often practiced making his mouth into a little
round circle and then puffing out his cheeks while he winked his eyes
rapidly; but he felt that he could never do it in the same cute and
irresistible way in which Teeka did it.
</p>

<p>
And as he watched her that afternoon, and wondered, a young bull ape
who had been lazily foraging for food beneath the damp, matted carpet
of decaying vegetation at the roots of a near-by tree lumbered
awkwardly in Teeka's direction.  The other apes of the tribe of Kerchak
moved listlessly about or lolled restfully in the midday heat of the
equatorial jungle.  From time to time one or another of them had passed
close to Teeka, and Tarzan had been uninterested.  Why was it then that
his brows contracted and his muscles tensed as he saw Taug pause beside
the young she and then squat down close to her?
</p>

<p>
Tarzan always had liked Taug.  Since childhood they had romped
together.  Side by side they had squatted near the water, their quick,
strong fingers ready to leap forth and seize Pisah, the fish, should
that wary denizen of the cool depths dart surfaceward to the lure of
the insects Tarzan tossed upon the face of the pool.
</p>

<p>
Together they had baited Tublat and teased Numa, the lion.  Why, then,
should Tarzan feel the rise of the short hairs at the nape of his neck
merely because Taug sat close to Teeka?
</p>

<p>
It is true that Taug was no longer the frolicsome ape of yesterday.
When his snarling-muscles bared his giant fangs no one could longer
imagine that Taug was in as playful a mood as when he and Tarzan had
rolled upon the turf in mimic battle.  The Taug of today was a huge,
sullen bull ape, somber and forbidding.  Yet he and Tarzan never had
quarreled.
</p>

<p>
For a few minutes the young ape-man watched Taug press closer to Teeka.
He saw the rough caress of the huge paw as it stroked the sleek
shoulder of the she, and then Tarzan of the Apes slipped catlike to the
ground and approached the two.
</p>

<p>
As he came his upper lip curled into a snarl, exposing his fighting
fangs, and a deep growl rumbled from his cavernous chest.  Taug looked
up, batting his blood-shot eyes.  Teeka half raised herself and looked
at Tarzan.  Did she guess the cause of his perturbation? Who may say?
At any rate, she was feminine, and so she reached up and scratched Taug
behind one of his small, flat ears.
</p>

<p>
Tarzan saw, and in the instant that he saw, Teeka was no longer the
little playmate of an hour ago; instead she was a wondrous thing—the
most wondrous in the world—and a possession for which Tarzan would
fight to the death against Taug or any other who dared question his
right of proprietorship.
</p>

<p>
Stooped, his muscles rigid and one great shoulder turned toward the
young bull, Tarzan of the Apes sidled nearer and nearer.  His face was
partly averted, but his keen gray eyes never left those of Taug, and as
he came, his growls increased in depth and volume.
</p>

<p>
Taug rose upon his short legs, bristling.  His fighting fangs were
bared.  He, too, sidled, stiff-legged, and growled.
</p>

<p>
"Teeka is Tarzan's," said the ape-man, in the low gutturals of the
great anthropoids.
</p>

<p>
"Teeka is Taug's," replied the bull ape.
</p>

<p>
Thaka and Numgo and Gunto, disturbed by the growlings of the two young
bulls, looked up half apathetic, half interested.  They were sleepy,
but they sensed a fight.  It would break the monotony of the humdrum
jungle life they led.
</p>

<p>
Coiled about his shoulders was Tarzan's long grass rope, in his hand
was the hunting knife of the long-dead father he had never known.  In
Taug's little brain lay a great respect for the shiny bit of sharp
metal which the ape-boy knew so well how to use.  With it had he slain
Tublat, his fierce foster father, and Bolgani, the gorilla.  Taug knew
these things, and so he came warily, circling about Tarzan in search of
an opening.  The latter, made cautious because of his lesser bulk and
the inferiority of his natural armament, followed similar tactics.
</p>

<p>
For a time it seemed that the altercation would follow the way of the
majority of such differences between members of the tribe and that one
of them would finally lose interest and wander off to prosecute some
other line of endeavor.  Such might have been the end of it had the
CASUS BELLI been other than it was; but Teeka was flattered at the
attention that was being drawn to her and by the fact that these two
young bulls were contemplating battle on her account.  Such a thing
never before had occurred in Teeka's brief life.  She had seen other
bulls battling for other and older shes, and in the depth of her wild
little heart she had longed for the day when the jungle grasses would
be reddened with the blood of mortal combat for her fair sake.
</p>

<p>
So now she squatted upon her haunches and insulted both her admirers
impartially.  She hurled taunts at them for their cowardice, and called
them vile names, such as Histah, the snake, and Dango, the hyena.  She
threatened to call Mumga to chastise them with a stick—Mumga, who was
so old that she could no longer climb and so toothless that she was
forced to confine her diet almost exclusively to bananas and grub-worms.
</p>

<p>
The apes who were watching heard and laughed.  Taug was infuriated.  He
made a sudden lunge for Tarzan, but the ape-boy leaped nimbly to one
side, eluding him, and with the quickness of a cat wheeled and leaped
back again to close quarters.  His hunting knife was raised above his
head as he came in, and he aimed a vicious blow at Taug's neck.  The
ape wheeled to dodge the weapon so that the keen blade struck him but a
glancing blow upon the shoulder.
</p>

<p>
The spurt of red blood brought a shrill cry of delight from Teeka.  Ah,
but this was something worth while!  She glanced about to see if others
had witnessed this evidence of her popularity.  Helen of Troy was never
one whit more proud than was Teeka at that moment.
</p>

<p>
If Teeka had not been so absorbed in her own vaingloriousness she might
have noted the rustling of leaves in the tree above her—a rustling
which was not caused by any movement of the wind, since there was no
wind.  And had she looked up she might have seen a sleek body crouching
almost directly over her and wicked yellow eyes glaring hungrily down
upon her, but Teeka did not look up.
</p>

<p>
With his wound Taug had backed off growling horribly.  Tarzan had
followed him, screaming insults at him, and menacing him with his
brandishing blade.  Teeka moved from beneath the tree in an effort to
keep close to the duelists.
</p>

<p>
The branch above Teeka bent and swayed a trifle with the movement of
the body of the watcher stretched along it.  Taug had halted now and
was preparing to make a new stand.  His lips were flecked with foam,
and saliva drooled from his jowls.  He stood with head lowered and arms
outstretched, preparing for a sudden charge to close quarters.  Could
he but lay his mighty hands upon that soft, brown skin the battle would
be his.  Taug considered Tarzan's manner of fighting unfair.  He would
not close.  Instead, he leaped nimbly just beyond the reach of Taug's
muscular fingers.
</p>

<p>
The ape-boy had as yet never come to a real trial of strength with a
bull ape, other than in play, and so he was not at all sure that it
would be safe to put his muscles to the test in a life and death
struggle.  Not that he was afraid, for Tarzan knew nothing of fear.
The instinct of self-preservation gave him caution—that was all.  He
took risks only when it seemed necessary, and then he would hesitate at
nothing.
</p>

<p>
His own method of fighting seemed best fitted to his build and to his
armament.  His teeth, while strong and sharp, were, as weapons of
offense, pitifully inadequate by comparison with the mighty fighting
fangs of the anthropoids.  By dancing about, just out of reach of an
antagonist, Tarzan could do infinite injury with his long, sharp
hunting knife, and at the same time escape many of the painful and
dangerous wounds which would be sure to follow his falling into the
clutches of a bull ape.
</p>

<p>
And so Taug charged and bellowed like a bull, and Tarzan of the Apes
danced lightly to this side and that, hurling jungle billingsgate at
his foe, the while he nicked him now and again with his knife.
</p>

<p>
There were lulls in the fighting when the two would stand panting for
breath, facing each other, mustering their wits and their forces for a
new onslaught.  It was during a pause such as this that Taug chanced to
let his eyes rove beyond his foeman.  Instantly the entire aspect of
the ape altered.  Rage left his countenance to be supplanted by an
expression of fear.
</p>

<p>
With a cry that every ape there recognized, Taug turned and fled.  No
need to question him—his warning proclaimed the near presence of their
ancient enemy.
</p>

<p>
Tarzan started to seek safety, as did the other members of the tribe,
and as he did so he heard a panther's scream mingled with the
frightened cry of a she-ape.  Taug heard, too; but he did not pause in
his flight.
</p>

<p>
With the ape-boy, however, it was different.  He looked back to see if
any member of the tribe was close pressed by the beast of prey, and the
sight that met his eyes filled them with an expression of horror.
</p>

<p>
Teeka it was who cried out in terror as she fled across a little
clearing toward the trees upon the opposite side, for after her leaped
Sheeta, the panther, in easy, graceful bounds.  Sheeta appeared to be
in no hurry.  His meat was assured, since even though the ape reached
the trees ahead of him she could not climb beyond his clutches before
he could be upon her.
</p>

<p>
Tarzan saw that Teeka must die.  He cried to Taug and the other bulls
to hasten to Teeka's assistance, and at the same time he ran toward the
pursuing beast, taking down his rope as he came.  Tarzan knew that once
the great bulls were aroused none of the jungle, not even Numa, the
lion, was anxious to measure fangs with them, and that if all those of
the tribe who chanced to be present today would charge, Sheeta, the
great cat, would doubtless turn tail and run for his life.
</p>

<p>
Taug heard, as did the others, but no one came to Tarzan's assistance
or Teeka's rescue, and Sheeta was rapidly closing up the distance
between himself and his prey.
</p>

<p>
The ape-boy, leaping after the panther, cried aloud to the beast in an
effort to turn it from Teeka or otherwise distract its attention until
the she-ape could gain the safety of the higher branches where Sheeta
dared not go.  He called the panther every opprobrious name that fell
to his tongue.  He dared him to stop and do battle with him; but Sheeta
only loped on after the luscious titbit now almost within his reach.
</p>

<p>
Tarzan was not far behind and he was gaining, but the distance was so
short that he scarce hoped to overhaul the carnivore before it had
felled Teeka.  In his right hand the boy swung his grass rope above his
head as he ran.  He hated to chance a miss, for the distance was much
greater than he ever had cast before except in practice.  It was the
full length of his grass rope which separated him from Sheeta, and yet
there was no other thing to do.  He could not reach the brute's side
before it overhauled Teeka.  He must chance a throw.
</p>

<p>
And just as Teeka sprang for the lower limb of a great tree, and Sheeta
rose behind her in a long, sinuous leap, the coils of the ape-boy's
grass rope shot swiftly through the air, straightening into a long thin
line as the open noose hovered for an instant above the savage head and
the snarling jaws.  Then it settled—clean and true about the tawny
neck it settled, and Tarzan, with a quick twist of his rope-hand, drew
the noose taut, bracing himself for the shock when Sheeta should have
taken up the slack.
</p>

<p>
Just short of Teeka's glossy rump the cruel talons raked the air as the
rope tightened and Sheeta was brought to a sudden stop—a stop that
snapped the big beast over upon his back.  Instantly Sheeta was
up—with glaring eyes, and lashing tail, and gaping jaws, from which
issued hideous cries of rage and disappointment.
</p>

<p>
He saw the ape-boy, the cause of his discomfiture, scarce forty feet
before him, and Sheeta charged.
</p>

<p>
Teeka was safe now; Tarzan saw to that by a quick glance into the tree
whose safety she had gained not an instant too soon, and Sheeta was
charging.  It was useless to risk his life in idle and unequal combat
from which no good could come; but could he escape a battle with the
enraged cat? And if he was forced to fight, what chance had he to
survive? Tarzan was constrained to admit that his position was aught
but a desirable one.  The trees were too far to hope to reach in time
to elude the cat.  Tarzan could but stand facing that hideous charge.
In his right hand he grasped his hunting knife—a puny, futile thing
indeed by comparison with the great rows of mighty teeth which lined
Sheeta's powerful jaws, and the sharp talons encased within his padded
paws; yet the young Lord Greystoke faced it with the same courageous
resignation with which some fearless ancestor went down to defeat and
death on Senlac Hill by Hastings.
</p>

<p>
From safety points in the trees the great apes watched, screaming
hatred at Sheeta and advice at Tarzan, for the progenitors of man have,
naturally, many human traits.  Teeka was frightened.  She screamed at
the bulls to hasten to Tarzan's assistance; but the bulls were
otherwise engaged—principally in giving advice and making faces.
Anyway, Tarzan was not a real Mangani, so why should they risk their
lives in an effort to protect him?
</p>

<p>
And now Sheeta was almost upon the lithe, naked body, and—the body was
not there.  Quick as was the great cat, the ape-boy was quicker.  He
leaped to one side almost as the panther's talons were closing upon
him, and as Sheeta went hurtling to the ground beyond, Tarzan was
racing for the safety of the nearest tree.
</p>

<p>
The panther recovered himself almost immediately and, wheeling, tore
after his prey, the ape-boy's rope dragging along the ground behind
him.  In doubling back after Tarzan, Sheeta had passed around a low
bush.  It was a mere nothing in the path of any jungle creature of the
size and weight of Sheeta—provided it had no trailing rope dangling
behind.  But Sheeta was handicapped by such a rope, and as he leaped
once again after Tarzan of the Apes the rope encircled the small bush,
became tangled in it and brought the panther to a sudden stop.  An
instant later Tarzan was safe among the higher branches of a small tree
into which Sheeta could not follow him.
</p>

<p>
Here he perched, hurling twigs and epithets at the raging feline
beneath him.  The other members of the tribe now took up the
bombardment, using such hard-shelled fruits and dead branches as came
within their reach, until Sheeta, goaded to frenzy and snapping at the
grass rope, finally succeeded in severing its strands.  For a moment
the panther stood glaring first at one of his tormentors and then at
another, until, with a final scream of rage, he turned and slunk off
into the tangled mazes of the jungle.
</p>

<p>
A half hour later the tribe was again upon the ground, feeding as
though naught had occurred to interrupt the somber dullness of their
lives.  Tarzan had recovered the greater part of his rope and was busy
fashioning a new noose, while Teeka squatted close behind him, in
evident token that her choice was made.
</p>

<p>
Taug eyed them sullenly.  Once when he came close, Teeka bared her
fangs and growled at him, and Tarzan showed his canines in an ugly
snarl; but Taug did not provoke a quarrel.  He seemed to accept after
the manner of his kind the decision of the she as an indication that he
had been vanquished in his battle for her favors.
</p>

<p>
Later in the day, his rope repaired, Tarzan took to the trees in search
of game.  More than his fellows he required meat, and so, while they
were satisfied with fruits and herbs and beetles, which could be
discovered without much effort upon their part, Tarzan spent
considerable time hunting the game animals whose flesh alone satisfied
the cravings of his stomach and furnished sustenance and strength to
the mighty thews which, day by day, were building beneath the soft,
smooth texture of his brown hide.
</p>

<p>
Taug saw him depart, and then, quite casually, the big beast hunted
closer and closer to Teeka in his search for food.  At last he was
within a few feet of her, and when he shot a covert glance at her he
saw that she was appraising him and that there was no evidence of anger
upon her face.
</p>

<p>
Taug expanded his great chest and rolled about on his short legs,
making strange growlings in his throat.  He raised his lips, baring his
fangs.  My, but what great, beautiful fangs he had! Teeka could not but
notice them.  She also let her eyes rest in admiration upon Taug's
beetling brows and his short, powerful neck.  What a beautiful creature
he was indeed!
</p>

<p>
Taug, flattered by the unconcealed admiration in her eyes, strutted
about, as proud and as vain as a peacock.  Presently he began to
inventory his assets, mentally, and shortly he found himself comparing
them with those of his rival.
</p>

<p>
Taug grunted, for there was no comparison.  How could one compare his
beautiful coat with the smooth and naked hideousness of Tarzan's bare
hide? Who could see beauty in the stingy nose of the Tarmangani after
looking at Taug's broad nostrils? And Tarzan's eyes! Hideous things,
showing white about them, and entirely unrimmed with red.  Taug knew
that his own blood-shot eyes were beautiful, for he had seen them
reflected in the glassy surface of many a drinking pool.
</p>

<p>
The bull drew nearer to Teeka, finally squatting close against her.
When Tarzan returned from his hunting a short time later it was to see
Teeka contentedly scratching the back of his rival.
</p>

<p>
Tarzan was disgusted.  Neither Taug nor Teeka saw him as he swung
through the trees into the glade.  He paused a moment, looking at them;
then, with a sorrowful grimace, he turned and faded away into the
labyrinth of leafy boughs and festooned moss out of which he had come.
</p>

<p>
Tarzan wished to be as far away from the cause of his heartache as he
could.  He was suffering the first pangs of blighted love, and he
didn't quite know what was the matter with him.  He thought that he was
angry with Taug, and so he couldn't understand why it was that he had
run away instead of rushing into mortal combat with the destroyer of
his happiness.
</p>

<p>
He also thought that he was angry with Teeka, yet a vision of her many
beauties persisted in haunting him, so that he could only see her in
the light of love as the most desirable thing in the world.
</p>

<p>
The ape-boy craved affection.  From babyhood until the time of her
death, when the poisoned arrow of Kulonga had pierced her savage heart,
Kala had represented to the English boy the sole object of love which
he had known.
</p>

<p>
In her wild, fierce way Kala had loved her adopted son, and Tarzan had
returned that love, though the outward demonstrations of it were no
greater than might have been expected from any other beast of the
jungle.  It was not until he was bereft of her that the boy realized
how deep had been his attachment for his mother, for as such he looked
upon her.
</p>

<p>
In Teeka he had seen within the past few hours a substitute for
Kala—someone to fight for and to hunt for—someone to caress; but now
his dream was shattered.  Something hurt within his breast.  He placed
his hand over his heart and wondered what had happened to him.  Vaguely
he attributed his pain to Teeka.  The more he thought of Teeka as he
had last seen her, caressing Taug, the more the thing within his breast
hurt him.
</p>

<p>
Tarzan shook his head and growled; then on and on through the jungle he
swung, and the farther he traveled and the more he thought upon his
wrongs, the nearer he approached becoming an irreclaimable misogynist.
</p>

<p>
Two days later he was still hunting alone—very morose and very
unhappy; but he was determined never to return to the tribe.  He could
not bear the thought of seeing Taug and Teeka always together.  As he
swung upon a great limb Numa, the lion, and Sabor, the lioness, passed
beneath him, side by side, and Sabor leaned against the lion and bit
playfully at his cheek.  It was a half-caress. Tarzan sighed and hurled
a nut at them.
</p>

<p>
Later he came upon several of Mbonga's black warriors.  He was upon the
point of dropping his noose about the neck of one of them, who was a
little distance from his companions, when he became interested in the
thing which occupied the savages.  They were building a cage in the
trail and covering it with leafy branches.  When they had completed
their work the structure was scarcely visible.
</p>

<p>
Tarzan wondered what the purpose of the thing might be, and why, when
they had built it, they turned away and started back along the trail in
the direction of their village.
</p>

<p>
It had been some time since Tarzan had visited the blacks and looked
down from the shelter of the great trees which overhung their palisade
upon the activities of his enemies, from among whom had come the slayer
of Kala.
</p>

<p>
Although he hated them, Tarzan derived considerable entertainment in
watching them at their daily life within the village, and especially at
their dances, when the fires glared against their naked bodies as they
leaped and turned and twisted in mimic warfare.  It was rather in the
hope of witnessing something of the kind that he now followed the
warriors back toward their village, but in this he was disappointed,
for there was no dance that night.
</p>

<p>
Instead, from the safe concealment of his tree, Tarzan saw little
groups seated about tiny fires discussing the events of the day, and in
the darker corners of the village he descried isolated couples talking
and laughing together, and always one of each couple was a young man
and the other a young woman.
</p>

<p>
Tarzan cocked his head upon one side and thought, and before he went to
sleep that night, curled in the crotch of the great tree above the
village, Teeka filled his mind, and afterward she filled his
dreams—she and the young black men laughing and talking with the young
black women.
</p>

<p>
Taug, hunting alone, had wandered some distance from the balance of the
tribe.  He was making his way slowly along an elephant path when he
discovered that it was blocked with undergrowth.  Now Taug, come into
maturity, was an evil-natured brute of an exceeding short temper.  When
something thwarted him, his sole idea was to overcome it by brute
strength and ferocity, and so now when he found his way blocked, he
tore angrily into the leafy screen and an instant later found himself
within a strange lair, his progress effectually blocked,
notwithstanding his most violent efforts to forge ahead.
</p>

<p>
Biting and striking at the barrier, Taug finally worked himself into a
frightful rage, but all to no avail; and at last he became convinced
that he must turn back.  But when he would have done so, what was his
chagrin to discover that another barrier had dropped behind him while
he fought to break down the one before him! Taug was trapped.  Until
exhaustion overcame him he fought frantically for his freedom; but all
for naught.
</p>

<p>
In the morning a party of blacks set out from the village of Mbonga in
the direction of the trap they had constructed the previous day, while
among the branches of the trees above them hovered a naked young giant
filled with the curiosity of the wild things.  Manu, the monkey,
chattered and scolded as Tarzan passed, and though he was not afraid of
the familiar figure of the ape-boy, he hugged closer to him the little
brown body of his life's companion.  Tarzan laughed as he saw it; but
the laugh was followed by a sudden clouding of his face and a deep sigh.
</p>

<p>
A little farther on, a gaily feathered bird strutted about before the
admiring eyes of his somber-hued mate.  It seemed to Tarzan that
everything in the jungle was combining to remind him that he had lost
Teeka; yet every day of his life he had seen these same things and
thought nothing of them.
</p>

<p>
When the blacks reached the trap, Taug set up a great commotion.
Seizing the bars of his prison, he shook them frantically, and all the
while he roared and growled terrifically.  The blacks were elated, for
while they had not built their trap for this hairy tree man, they were
delighted with their catch.
</p>

<p>
Tarzan pricked up his ears when he heard the voice of a great ape and,
circling quickly until he was down wind from the trap, he sniffed at
the air in search of the scent spoor of the prisoner.  Nor was it long
before there came to those delicate nostrils the familiar odor that
told Tarzan the identity of the captive as unerringly as though he had
looked upon Taug with his eyes.  Yes, it was Taug, and he was alone.
</p>

<p>
Tarzan grinned as he approached to discover what the blacks would do to
their prisoner.  Doubtless they would slay him at once.  Again Tarzan
grinned.  Now he could have Teeka for his own, with none to dispute his
right to her.  As he watched, he saw the black warriors strip the
screen from about the cage, fasten ropes to it and drag it away along
the trail in the direction of their village.
</p>

<p>
Tarzan watched until his rival passed out of sight, still beating upon
the bars of his prison and growling out his anger and his threats.
Then the ape-boy turned and swung rapidly off in search of the tribe,
and Teeka.
</p>

<p>
Once, upon the journey, he surprised Sheeta and his family in a little
overgrown clearing.  The great cat lay stretched upon the ground, while
his mate, one paw across her lord's savage face, licked at the soft
white fur at his throat.
</p>

<p>
Tarzan increased his speed then until he fairly flew through the
forest, nor was it long before he came upon the tribe.  He saw them
before they saw him, for of all the jungle creatures, none passed more
quietly than Tarzan of the Apes.  He saw Kamma and her mate feeding
side by side, their hairy bodies rubbing against each other.  And he
saw Teeka feeding by herself.  Not for long would she feed thus in
loneliness, thought Tarzan, as with a bound he landed amongst them.
</p>

<p>
There was a startled rush and a chorus of angry and frightened snarls,
for Tarzan had surprised them; but there was more, too, than mere
nervous shock to account for the bristling neck hair which remained
standing long after the apes had discovered the identity of the
newcomer.
</p>

<p>
Tarzan noticed this as he had noticed it many times in the past—that
always his sudden coming among them left them nervous and unstrung for
a considerable time, and that they one and all found it necessary to
satisfy themselves that he was indeed Tarzan by smelling about him a
half dozen or more times before they calmed down.
</p>

<p>
Pushing through them, he made his way toward Teeka; but as he
approached her the ape drew away.
</p>

<p>
"Teeka," he said, "it is Tarzan.  You belong to Tarzan.  I have come
for you."
</p>

<p>
The ape drew closer, looking him over carefully.  Finally she sniffed
at him, as though to make assurance doubly sure.
</p>

<p>
"Where is Taug?" she asked.
</p>

<p>
"The Gomangani have him," replied Tarzan.  "They will kill him."
</p>

<p>
In the eyes of the she, Tarzan saw a wistful expression and a troubled
look of sorrow as he told her of Taug's fate; but she came quite close
and snuggled against him, and Tarzan, Lord Greystoke, put his arm about
her.
</p>

<p>
As he did so he noticed, with a start, the strange incongruity of that
smooth, brown arm against the black and hairy coat of his lady-love. He
recalled the paw of Sheeta's mate across Sheeta's face—no incongruity
there.  He thought of little Manu hugging his she, and how the one
seemed to belong to the other.  Even the proud male bird, with his gay
plumage, bore a close resemblance to his quieter spouse, while Numa,
but for his shaggy mane, was almost a counterpart of Sabor, the
lioness.  The males and the females differed, it was true; but not with
such differences as existed between Tarzan and Teeka.
</p>

<p>
Tarzan was puzzled.  There was something wrong.  His arm dropped from
the shoulder of Teeka.  Very slowly he drew away from her.  She looked
at him with her head cocked upon one side.  Tarzan rose to his full
height and beat upon his breast with his fists.  He raised his head
toward the heavens and opened his mouth.  From the depths of his lungs
rose the fierce, weird challenge of the victorious bull ape.  The tribe
turned curiously to eye him.  He had killed nothing, nor was there any
antagonist to be goaded to madness by the savage scream.  No, there was
no excuse for it, and they turned back to their feeding, but with an
eye upon the ape-man lest he be preparing to suddenly run amuck.
</p>

<p>
As they watched him they saw him swing into a near-by tree and
disappear from sight.  Then they forgot him, even Teeka.
</p>

<p>
Mbonga's black warriors, sweating beneath their strenuous task, and
resting often, made slow progress toward their village.  Always the
savage beast in the primitive cage growled and roared when they moved
him.  He beat upon the bars and slavered at the mouth.  His noise was
hideous.
</p>

<p>
They had almost completed their journey and were making their final
rest before forging ahead to gain the clearing in which lay their
village.  A few more minutes would have taken them out of the forest,
and then, doubtless, the thing would not have happened which did happen.
</p>

<p>
A silent figure moved through the trees above them.  Keen eyes
inspected the cage and counted the number of warriors.  An alert and
daring brain figured upon the chances of success when a certain plan
should be put to the test.
</p>

<p>
Tarzan watched the blacks lolling in the shade.  They were exhausted.
Already several of them slept.  He crept closer, pausing just above
them.  Not a leaf rustled before his stealthy advance.  He waited in
the infinite patience of the beast of prey.  Presently but two of the
warriors remained awake, and one of these was dozing.
</p>

<p>
Tarzan of the Apes gathered himself, and as he did so the black who did
not sleep arose and passed around to the rear of the cage.  The ape-boy
followed just above his head.  Taug was eyeing the warrior and emitting
low growls.  Tarzan feared that the anthropoid would awaken the
sleepers.
</p>

<p>
In a whisper which was inaudible to the ears of the Negro, Tarzan
whispered Taug's name, cautioning the ape to silence, and Taug's
growling ceased.
</p>

<p>
The black approached the rear of the cage and examined the fastenings
of the door, and as he stood there the beast above him launched itself
from the tree full upon his back.  Steel fingers circled his throat,
choking the cry which sprang to the lips of the terrified man.  Strong
teeth fastened themselves in his shoulder, and powerful legs wound
themselves about his torso.
</p>

<p>
The black in a frenzy of terror tried to dislodge the silent thing
which clung to him.  He threw himself to the ground and rolled about;
but still those mighty fingers closed more and more tightly their
deadly grip.
</p>

<p>
The man's mouth gaped wide, his swollen tongue protruded, his eyes
started from their sockets; but the relentless fingers only increased
their pressure.
</p>

<p>
Taug was a silent witness of the struggle.  In his fierce little brain
he doubtless wondered what purpose prompted Tarzan to attack the black.
Taug had not forgotten his recent battle with the ape-boy, nor the
cause of it.  Now he saw the form of the Gomangani suddenly go limp.
There was a convulsive shiver and the man lay still.
</p>

<p>
Tarzan sprang from his prey and ran to the door of the cage.  With
nimble fingers he worked rapidly at the thongs which held the door in
place.  Taug could only watch—he could not help.  Presently Tarzan
pushed the thing up a couple of feet and Taug crawled out.  The ape
would have turned upon the sleeping blacks that he might wreak his pent
vengeance; but Tarzan would not permit it.
</p>

<p>
Instead, the ape-boy dragged the body of the black within the cage and
propped it against the side bars.  Then he lowered the door and made
fast the thongs as they had been before.
</p>

<p>
A happy smile lighted his features as he worked, for one of his
principal diversions was the baiting of the blacks of Mbonga's village.
He could imagine their terror when they awoke and found the dead body
of their comrade fast in the cage where they had left the great ape
safely secured but a few minutes before.
</p>

<p>
Tarzan and Taug took to the trees together, the shaggy coat of the
fierce ape brushing the sleek skin of the English lordling as they
passed through the primeval jungle side by side.
</p>

<p>
"Go back to Teeka," said Tarzan.  "She is yours.  Tarzan does not want
her."
</p>

<p>
"Tarzan has found another she?" asked Taug.
</p>

<p>
The ape-boy shrugged.
</p>

<p>
"For the Gomangani there is another Gomangani," he said; "for Numa, the
lion, there is Sabor, the lioness; for Sheeta there is a she of his own
kind; for Bara, the deer; for Manu, the monkey; for all the beasts and
the birds of the jungle is there a mate.  Only for Tarzan of the Apes
is there none.  Taug is an ape.  Teeka is an ape.  Go back to Teeka.
Tarzan is a man.  He will go alone."

<h3 align="center">
The Capture of Tarzan
</h3>

<p>
THE BLACK WARRIORS labored in the humid heat of the jungle's stifling
shade.  With war spears they loosened the thick, black loam and the
deep layers of rotting vegetation.  With heavy-nailed fingers they
scooped away the disintegrated earth from the center of the age-old
game trail.  Often they ceased their labors to squat, resting and
gossiping, with much laughter, at the edge of the pit they were digging.
</p>

<p>
Against the boles of near-by trees leaned their long, oval shields of
thick buffalo hide, and the spears of those who were doing the
scooping.  Sweat glistened upon their smooth, ebon skins, beneath which
rolled rounded muscles, supple in the perfection of nature's
uncontaminated health.
</p>

<p>
A reed buck, stepping warily along the trail toward water, halted as a
burst of laughter broke upon his startled ears.  For a moment he stood
statuesque but for his sensitively dilating nostrils; then he wheeled
and fled noiselessly from the terrifying presence of man.
</p>

<p>
A hundred yards away, deep in the tangle of impenetrable jungle, Numa,
the lion, raised his massive head.  Numa had dined well until almost
daybreak and it had required much noise to awaken him.  Now he lifted
his muzzle and sniffed the air, caught the acrid scent spoor of the
reed buck and the heavy scent of man.  But Numa was well filled.  With
a low, disgusted grunt he rose and slunk away.
</p>

<p>
Brilliantly plumaged birds with raucous voices darted from tree to
tree.  Little monkeys, chattering and scolding, swung through the
swaying limbs above the black warriors.  Yet they were alone, for the
teeming jungle with all its myriad life, like the swarming streets of a
great metropolis, is one of the loneliest spots in God's great universe.
</p>

<p>
But were they alone?
</p>

<p>
Above them, lightly balanced upon a leafy tree limb, a gray-eyed youth
watched with eager intentness their every move.  The fire of hate,
restrained, smoldered beneath the lad's evident desire to know the
purpose of the black men's labors.  Such a one as these it was who had
slain his beloved Kala.  For them there could be naught but enmity, yet
he liked well to watch them, avid as he was for greater knowledge of
the ways of man.
</p>

<p>
He saw the pit grow in depth until a great hole yawned the width of the
trail—a hole which was amply large enough to hold at one time all of
the six excavators.  Tarzan could not guess the purpose of so great a
labor.  And when they cut long stakes, sharpened at their upper ends,
and set them at intervals upright in the bottom of the pit, his
wonderment but increased, nor was it satisfied with the placing of the
light cross-poles over the pit, or the careful arrangement of leaves
and earth which completely hid from view the work the black men had
performed.
</p>

<p>
When they were done they surveyed their handiwork with evident
satisfaction, and Tarzan surveyed it, too.  Even to his practiced eye
there remained scarce a vestige of evidence that the ancient game trail
had been tampered with in any way.
</p>

<p>
So absorbed was the ape-man in speculation as to the purpose of the
covered pit that he permitted the blacks to depart in the direction of
their village without the usual baiting which had rendered him the
terror of Mbonga's people and had afforded Tarzan both a vehicle of
revenge and a source of inexhaustible delight.
</p>

<p>
Puzzle as he would, however, he could not solve the mystery of the
concealed pit, for the ways of the blacks were still strange ways to
Tarzan.  They had entered his jungle but a short time before—the first
of their kind to encroach upon the age-old supremacy of the beasts
which laired there.  To Numa, the lion, to Tantor, the elephant, to the
great apes and the lesser apes, to each and all of the myriad creatures
of this savage wild, the ways of man were new.  They had much to learn
of these black, hairless creatures that walked erect upon their hind
paws—and they were learning it slowly, and always to their sorrow.
</p>

<p>
Shortly after the blacks had departed, Tarzan swung easily to the
trail.  Sniffing suspiciously, he circled the edge of the pit.
Squatting upon his haunches, he scraped away a little earth to expose
one of the cross-bars. He sniffed at this, touched it, cocked his head
upon one side, and contemplated it gravely for several minutes.  Then
he carefully re-covered it, arranging the earth as neatly as had the
blacks.  This done, he swung himself back among the branches of the
trees and moved off in search of his hairy fellows, the great apes of
the tribe of Kerchak.
</p>

<p>
Once he crossed the trail of Numa, the lion, pausing for a moment to
hurl a soft fruit at the snarling face of his enemy, and to taunt and
insult him, calling him eater of carrion and brother of Dango, the
hyena.  Numa, his yellow-green eyes round and burning with concentrated
hate, glared up at the dancing figure above him.  Low growls vibrated
his heavy jowls and his great rage transmitted to his sinuous tail a
sharp, whiplike motion; but realizing from past experience the futility
of long distance argument with the ape-man, he turned presently and
struck off into the tangled vegetation which hid him from the view of
his tormentor.  With a final scream of jungle invective and an apelike
grimace at his departing foe, Tarzan continued along his way.
</p>

<p>
Another mile and a shifting wind brought to his keen nostrils a
familiar, pungent odor close at hand, and a moment later there loomed
beneath him a huge, gray-black bulk forging steadily along the jungle
trail.  Tarzan seized and broke a small tree limb, and at the sudden
cracking sound the ponderous figure halted.  Great ears were thrown
forward, and a long, supple trunk rose quickly to wave to and fro in
search of the scent of an enemy, while two weak, little eyes peered
suspiciously and futilely about in quest of the author of the noise
which had disturbed his peaceful way.
</p>

<p>
Tarzan laughed aloud and came closer above the head of the pachyderm.
</p>

<p>
"Tantor! Tantor!" he cried.  "Bara, the deer, is less fearful than
you—you, Tantor, the elephant, greatest of the jungle folk with the
strength of as many Numas as I have toes upon my feet and fingers upon
my hands.  Tantor, who can uproot great trees, trembles with fear at
the sound of a broken twig."
</p>

<p>
A rumbling noise, which might have been either a sign of contempt or a
sigh of relief, was Tantor's only reply as the uplifted trunk and ears
came down and the beast's tail dropped to normal; but his eyes still
roved about in search of Tarzan.  He was not long kept in suspense,
however, as to the whereabouts of the ape-man, for a second later the
youth dropped lightly to the broad head of his old friend.  Then
stretching himself at full length, he drummed with his bare toes upon
the thick hide, and as his fingers scratched the more tender surfaces
beneath the great ears, he talked to Tantor of the gossip of the jungle
as though the great beast understood every word that he said.
</p>

<p>
Much there was which Tarzan could make Tantor understand, and though
the small talk of the wild was beyond the great, gray dreadnaught of
the jungle, he stood with blinking eyes and gently swaying trunk as
though drinking in every word of it with keenest appreciation.  As a
matter of fact it was the pleasant, friendly voice and caressing hands
behind his ears which he enjoyed, and the close proximity of him whom
he had often borne upon his back since Tarzan, as a little child, had
once fearlessly approached the great bull, assuming upon the part of
the pachyderm the same friendliness which filled his own heart.
</p>

<p>
In the years of their association Tarzan had discovered that he
possessed an inexplicable power to govern and direct his mighty friend.
At his bidding, Tantor would come from a great distance—as far as his
keen ears could detect the shrill and piercing summons of the
ape-man—and when Tarzan was squatted upon his head, Tantor would
lumber through the jungle in any direction which his rider bade him go.
It was the power of the man-mind over that of the brute and it was just
as effective as though both fully understood its origin, though neither
did.
</p>

<p>
For half an hour Tarzan sprawled there upon Tantor's back.  Time had no
meaning for either of them.  Life, as they saw it, consisted
principally in keeping their stomachs filled.  To Tarzan this was a
less arduous labor than to Tantor, for Tarzan's stomach was smaller,
and being omnivorous, food was less difficult to obtain.  If one sort
did not come readily to hand, there were always many others to satisfy
his hunger.  He was less particular as to his diet than Tantor, who
would eat only the bark of certain trees, and the wood of others, while
a third appealed to him only through its leaves, and these, perhaps,
just at certain seasons of the year.
</p>

<p>
Tantor must needs spend the better part of his life in filling his
immense stomach against the needs of his mighty thews.  It is thus with
all the lower orders—their lives are so occupied either with searching
for food or with the processes of digestion that they have little time
for other considerations.  Doubtless it is this handicap which has kept
them from advancing as rapidly as man, who has more time to give to
thought upon other matters.
</p>

<p>
However, these questions troubled Tarzan but little, and Tantor not at
all.  What the former knew was that he was happy in the companionship
of the elephant.  He did not know why.  He did not know that because he
was a human being—a normal, healthy human being—he craved some living
thing upon which to lavish his affection.  His childhood playmates
among the apes of Kerchak were now great, sullen brutes.  They felt nor
inspired but little affection.  The younger apes Tarzan still played
with occasionally.  In his savage way he loved them; but they were far
from satisfying or restful companions.  Tantor was a great mountain of
calm, of poise, of stability.  It was restful and satisfying to sprawl
upon his rough pate and pour one's vague hopes and aspirations into the
great ears which flapped ponderously to and fro in apparent
understanding.  Of all the jungle folk, Tantor commanded Tarzan's
greatest love since Kala had been taken from him.  Sometimes Tarzan
wondered if Tantor reciprocated his affection.  It was difficult to
know.
</p>

<p>
It was the call of the stomach—the most compelling and insistent call
which the jungle knows—that took Tarzan finally back to the trees and
off in search of food, while Tantor continued his interrupted journey
in the opposite direction.
</p>

<p>
For an hour the ape-man foraged.  A lofty nest yielded its fresh, warm
harvest.  Fruits, berries, and tender plantain found a place upon his
menu in the order that he happened upon them, for he did not seek such
foods.  Meat, meat, meat! It was always meat that Tarzan of the Apes
hunted; but sometimes meat eluded him, as today.
</p>

<p>
And as he roamed the jungle his active mind busied itself not alone
with his hunting, but with many other subjects.  He had a habit of
recalling often the events of the preceding days and hours.  He lived
over his visit with Tantor; he cogitated upon the digging blacks and
the strange, covered pit they had left behind them.  He wondered again
and again what its purpose might be.  He compared perceptions and
arrived at judgments.  He compared judgments, reaching conclusions—not
always correct ones, it is true, but at least he used his brain for the
purpose God intended it, which was the less difficult because he was
not handicapped by the second-hand, and usually erroneous, judgment of
others.
</p>

<p>
And as he puzzled over the covered pit, there loomed suddenly before
his mental vision a huge, gray-black bulk which lumbered ponderously
along a jungle trail.  Instantly Tarzan tensed to the shock of a sudden
fear.  Decision and action usually occurred simultaneously in the life
of the ape-man, and now he was away through the leafy branches ere the
realization of the pit's purpose had scarce formed in his mind.
</p>

<p>
Swinging from swaying limb to swaying limb, he raced through the middle
terraces where the trees grew close together.  Again he dropped to the
ground and sped, silently and light of foot, over the carpet of
decaying vegetation, only to leap again into the trees where the
tangled undergrowth precluded rapid advance upon the surface.
</p>

<p>
In his anxiety he cast discretion to the winds.  The caution of the
beast was lost in the loyalty of the man, and so it came that he
entered a large clearing, denuded of trees, without a thought of what
might lie there or upon the farther edge to dispute the way with him.
</p>

<p>
He was half way across when directly in his path and but a few yards
away there rose from a clump of tall grasses a half dozen chattering
birds.  Instantly Tarzan turned aside, for he knew well enough what
manner of creature the presence of these little sentinels proclaimed.
Simultaneously Buto, the rhinoceros, scrambled to his short legs and
charged furiously.  Haphazard charges Buto, the rhinoceros.  With his
weak eyes he sees but poorly even at short distances, and whether his
erratic rushes are due to the panic of fear as he attempts to escape,
or to the irascible temper with which he is generally credited, it is
difficult to determine.  Nor is the matter of little moment to one whom
Buto charges, for if he be caught and tossed, the chances are that
naught will interest him thereafter.
</p>

<p>
And today it chanced that Buto bore down straight upon Tarzan, across
the few yards of knee-deep grass which separated them.  Accident
started him in the direction of the ape-man, and then his weak eyes
discerned the enemy, and with a series of snorts he charged straight
for him.  The little rhino birds fluttered and circled about their
giant ward.  Among the branches of the trees at the edge of the
clearing, a score or more monkeys chattered and scolded as the loud
snorts of the angry beast sent them scurrying affrightedly to the upper
terraces.  Tarzan alone appeared indifferent and serene.
</p>

<p>
Directly in the path of the charge he stood.  There had been no time to
seek safety in the trees beyond the clearing, nor had Tarzan any mind
to delay his journey because of Buto.  He had met the stupid beast
before and held him in fine contempt.
</p>

<p>
And now Buto was upon him, the massive head lowered and the long, heavy
horn inclined for the frightful work for which nature had designed it;
but as he struck upward, his weapon raked only thin air, for the
ape-man had sprung lightly aloft with a catlike leap that carried him
above the threatening horn to the broad back of the rhinoceros.
Another spring and he was on the ground behind the brute and racing
like a deer for the trees.
</p>

<p>
Buto, angered and mystified by the strange disappearance of his prey,
wheeled and charged frantically in another direction, which chanced to
be not the direction of Tarzan's flight, and so the ape-man came in
safety to the trees and continued on his swift way through the forest.
</p>

<p>
Some distance ahead of him Tantor moved steadily along the well-worn
elephant trail, and ahead of Tantor a crouching, black warrior listened
intently in the middle of the path.  Presently he heard the sound for
which he had been hoping—the cracking, snapping sound which heralded
the approach of an elephant.
</p>

<p>
To his right and left in other parts of the jungle other warriors were
watching.  A low signal, passed from one to another, apprised the most
distant that the quarry was afoot.  Rapidly they converged toward the
trail, taking positions in trees down wind from the point at which
Tantor must pass them.  Silently they waited and presently were
rewarded by the sight of a mighty tusker carrying an amount of ivory in
his long tusks that set their greedy hearts to palpitating.
</p>

<p>
No sooner had he passed their positions than the warriors clambered
from their perches.  No longer were they silent, but instead clapped
their hands and shouted as they reached the ground.  For an instant
Tantor, the elephant, paused with upraised trunk and tail, with great
ears up-pricked, and then he swung on along the trail at a rapid,
shuffling pace—straight toward the covered pit with its sharpened
stakes upstanding in the ground.
</p>

<p>
Behind him came the yelling warriors, urging him on in the rapid flight
which would not permit a careful examination of the ground before him.
Tantor, the elephant, who could have turned and scattered his
adversaries with a single charge, fled like a frightened deer—fled
toward a hideous, torturing death.
</p>

<p>
And behind them all came Tarzan of the Apes, racing through the jungle
forest with the speed and agility of a squirrel, for he had heard the
shouts of the warriors and had interpreted them correctly.  Once he
uttered a piercing call that reverberated through the jungle; but
Tantor, in the panic of terror, either failed to hear, or hearing,
dared not pause to heed.
</p>

<p>
Now the giant pachyderm was but a few yards from the hidden death
lurking in his path, and the blacks, certain of success, were screaming
and dancing in his wake, waving their war spears and celebrating in
advance the acquisition of the splendid ivory carried by their prey and
the surfeit of elephant meat which would be theirs this night.
</p>

<p>
So intent were they upon their gratulations that they entirely failed
to note the silent passage of the man-beast above their heads, nor did
Tantor, either, see or hear him, even though Tarzan called to him to
stop.
</p>

<p>
A few more steps would precipitate Tantor upon the sharpened stakes;
Tarzan fairly flew through the trees until he had come abreast of the
fleeing animal and then had passed him.  At the pit's verge the ape-man
dropped to the ground in the center of the trail.  Tantor was almost
upon him before his weak eyes permitted him to recognize his old friend.
</p>

<p>
"Stop!" cried Tarzan, and the great beast halted to the upraised hand.
</p>

<p>
Tarzan turned and kicked aside some of the brush which hid the pit.
Instantly Tantor saw and understood.
</p>

<p>
"Fight!" growled Tarzan.  "They are coming behind you." But Tantor, the
elephant, is a huge bunch of nerves, and now he was half panic-stricken
by terror.
</p>

<p>
Before him yawned the pit, how far he did not know, but to right and
left lay the primeval jungle untouched by man.  With a squeal the great
beast turned suddenly at right angles and burst his noisy way through
the solid wall of matted vegetation that would have stopped any but him.
</p>

<p>
Tarzan, standing upon the edge of the pit, smiled as he watched
Tantor's undignified flight.  Soon the blacks would come.  It was best
that Tarzan of the Apes faded from the scene.  He essayed a step from
the pit's edge, and as he threw the weight of his body upon his left
foot, the earth crumbled away.  Tarzan made a single Herculean effort
to throw himself forward, but it was too late.  Backward and downward
he went toward the sharpened stakes in the bottom of the pit.
</p>

<p>
When, a moment later, the blacks came they saw even from a distance
that Tantor had eluded them, for the size of the hole in the pit
covering was too small to have accommodated the huge bulk of an
elephant.  At first they thought that their prey had put one great foot
through the top and then, warned, drawn back; but when they had come to
the pit's verge and peered over, their eyes went wide in astonishment,
for, quiet and still, at the bottom lay the naked figure of a white
giant.
</p>

<p>
Some of them there had glimpsed this forest god before and they drew
back in terror, awed by the presence which they had for some time
believed to possess the miraculous powers of a demon; but others there
were who pushed forward, thinking only of the capture of an enemy, and
these leaped into the pit and lifted Tarzan out.
</p>

<p>
There was no scar upon his body.  None of the sharpened stakes had
pierced him—only a swollen spot at the base of the brain indicated the
nature of his injury.  In the falling backward his head had struck upon
the side of one of the stakes, rendering him unconscious.  The blacks
were quick to discover this, and equally quick to bind their prisoner's
arms and legs before he should regain consciousness, for they had
learned to harbor a wholesome respect for this strange man-beast that
consorted with the hairy tree folk.
</p>

<p>
They had carried him but a short distance toward their village when the
ape-man's eyelids quivered and raised.  He looked about him wonderingly
for a moment, and then full consciousness returned and he realized the
seriousness of his predicament.  Accustomed almost from birth to
relying solely upon his own resources, he did not cast about for
outside aid now, but devoted his mind to a consideration of the
possibilities for escape which lay within himself and his own powers.
</p>

<p>
He did not dare test the strength of his bonds while the blacks were
carrying him, for fear they would become apprehensive and add to them.
Presently his captors discovered that he was conscious, and as they had
little stomach for carrying a heavy man through the jungle heat, they
set him upon his feet and forced him forward among them, pricking him
now and then with their spears, yet with every manifestation of the
superstitious awe in which they held him.
</p>

<p>
When they discovered that their prodding brought no outward evidence of
suffering, their awe increased, so that they soon desisted, half
believing that this strange white giant was a supernatural being and so
was immune from pain.
</p>

<p>
As they approached their village, they shouted aloud the victorious
cries of successful warriors, so that by the time they reached the
gate, dancing and waving their spears, a great crowd of men, women, and
children were gathered there to greet them and hear the story of their
adventure.
</p>

<p>
As the eyes of the villagers fell upon the prisoner, they went wild,
and heavy jaws fell open in astonishment and incredulity.  For months
they had lived in perpetual terror of a weird, white demon whom but few
had ever glimpsed and lived to describe.  Warriors had disappeared from
the paths almost within sight of the village and from the midst of
their companions as mysteriously and completely as though they had been
swallowed by the earth, and later, at night, their dead bodies had
fallen, as from the heavens, into the village street.
</p>

<p>
This fearsome creature had appeared by night in the huts of the
village, killed, and disappeared, leaving behind him in the huts with
his dead, strange and terrifying evidences of an uncanny sense of humor.
</p>

<p>
But now he was in their power! No longer could he terrorize them.
Slowly the realization of this dawned upon them.  A woman, screaming,
ran forward and struck the ape-man across the face.  Another and
another followed her example, until Tarzan of the Apes was surrounded
by a fighting, clawing, yelling mob of natives.
</p>

<p>
And then Mbonga, the chief, came, and laying his spear heavily across
the shoulders of his people, drove them from their prey.
</p>

<p>
"We will save him until night," he said.
</p>

<p>
Far out in the jungle Tantor, the elephant, his first panic of fear
allayed, stood with up-pricked ears and undulating trunk.  What was
passing through the convolutions of his savage brain? Could he be
searching for Tarzan?  Could he recall and measure the service the
ape-man had performed for him? Of that there can be no doubt.  But did
he feel gratitude? Would he have risked his own life to have saved
Tarzan could he have known of the danger which confronted his friend?
You will doubt it.  Anyone at all familiar with elephants will doubt
it.  Englishmen who have hunted much with elephants in India will tell
you that they never have heard of an instance in which one of these
animals has gone to the aid of a man in danger, even though the man had
often befriended it.  And so it is to be doubted that Tantor would have
attempted to overcome his instinctive fear of the black men in an
effort to succor Tarzan.
</p>

<p>
The screams of the infuriated villagers came faintly to his sensitive
ears, and he wheeled, as though in terror, contemplating flight; but
something stayed him, and again he turned about, raised his trunk, and
gave voice to a shrill cry.
</p>

<p>
Then he stood listening.
</p>

<p>
In the distant village where Mbonga had restored quiet and order, the
voice of Tantor was scarcely audible to the blacks, but to the keen
ears of Tarzan of the Apes it bore its message.
</p>

<p>
His captors were leading him to a hut where he might be confined and
guarded against the coming of the nocturnal orgy that would mark his
torture-laden death.  He halted as he heard the notes of Tantor's call,
and raising his head, gave vent to a terrifying scream that sent cold
chills through the superstitious blacks and caused the warriors who
guarded him to leap back even though their prisoner's arms were
securely bound behind him.
</p>

<p>
With raised spears they encircled him as for a moment longer he stood
listening.  Faintly from the distance came another, an answering cry,
and Tarzan of the Apes, satisfied, turned and quietly pursued his way
toward the hut where he was to be imprisoned.
</p>

<p>
The afternoon wore on.  From the surrounding village the ape-man heard
the bustle of preparation for the feast.  Through the doorway of the
hut he saw the women laying the cooking fires and filling their earthen
caldrons with water; but above it all his ears were bent across the
jungle in eager listening for the coming of Tantor.
</p>

<p>
Even Tarzan but half believed that he would come.  He knew Tantor even
better than Tantor knew himself.  He knew the timid heart which lay in
the giant body.  He knew the panic of terror which the scent of the
Gomangani inspired within that savage breast, and as night drew on,
hope died within his heart and in the stoic calm of the wild beast
which he was, he resigned himself to meet the fate which awaited him.
</p>

<p>
All afternoon he had been working, working, working with the bonds that
held his wrists.  Very slowly they were giving.  He might free his
hands before they came to lead him out to be butchered, and if he
did—Tarzan licked his lips in anticipation, and smiled a cold, grim
smile.  He could imagine the feel of soft flesh beneath his fingers and
the sinking of his white teeth into the throats of his foemen.  He
would let them taste his wrath before they overpowered him!
</p>

<p>
At last they came—painted, befeathered warriors—even more hideous
than nature had intended them.  They came and pushed him into the open,
where his appearance was greeted by wild shouts from the assembled
villagers.
</p>

<p>
To the stake they led him, and as they pushed him roughly against it
preparatory to binding him there securely for the dance of death that
would presently encircle him, Tarzan tensed his mighty thews and with a
single, powerful wrench parted the loosened thongs which had secured
his hands.  Like thought, for quickness, he leaped forward among the
warriors nearest him.  A blow sent one to earth, as, growling and
snarling, the beast-man leaped upon the breast of another.  His fangs
were buried instantly in the jugular of his adversary and then a half
hundred black men had leaped upon him and borne him to earth.
</p>

<p>
Striking, clawing, and snapping, the ape-man fought—fought as his
foster people had taught him to fight—fought like a wild beast
cornered.  His strength, his agility, his courage, and his intelligence
rendered him easily a match for half a dozen black men in a
hand-to-hand struggle, but not even Tarzan of the Apes could hope to
successfully cope with half a hundred.
</p>

<p>
Slowly they were overpowering him, though a score of them bled from
ugly wounds, and two lay very still beneath the trampling feet, and the
rolling bodies of the contestants.
</p>

<p>
Overpower him they might, but could they keep him overpowered while
they bound him? A half hour of desperate endeavor convinced them that
they could not, and so Mbonga, who, like all good rulers, had circled
in the safety of the background, called to one to work his way in and
spear the victim.  Gradually, through the milling, battling men, the
warrior approached the object of his quest.
</p>

<p>
He stood with poised spear above his head waiting for the instant that
would expose a vulnerable part of the ape-man's body and still not
endanger one of the blacks.  Closer and closer he edged about,
following the movements of the twisting, scuffling combatants.  The
growls of the ape-man sent cold chills up the warrior's spine, causing
him to go carefully lest he miss at the first cast and lay himself open
to an attack from those merciless teeth and mighty hands.
</p>

<p>
At last he found an opening.  Higher he raised his spear, tensing his
muscles, rolling beneath his glistening, ebon hide, and then from the
jungle just beyond the palisade came a thunderous crashing.  The
spear-hand paused, the black cast a quick glance in the direction of
the disturbance, as did the others of the blacks who were not occupied
with the subjugation of the ape-man.
</p>

<p>
In the glare of the fires they saw a huge bulk topping the barrier.
They saw the palisade belly and sway inward.  They saw it burst as
though built of straws, and an instant later Tantor, the elephant,
thundered down upon them.
</p>

<p>
To right and left the blacks fled, screaming in terror.  Some who
hovered upon the verge of the strife with Tarzan heard and made good
their escape, but a half dozen there were so wrapt in the blood-madness
of battle that they failed to note the approach of the giant tusker.
</p>

<p>
Upon these Tantor charged, trumpeting furiously.  Above them he
stopped, his sensitive trunk weaving among them, and there, at the
bottom, he found Tarzan, bloody, but still battling.
</p>

<p>
A warrior turned his eyes upward from the melee.  Above him towered the
gigantic bulk of the pachyderm, the little eyes flashing with the
reflected light of the fires—wicked, frightful, terrifying.  The
warrior screamed, and as he screamed, the sinuous trunk encircled him,
lifted him high above the ground, and hurled him far after the fleeing
crowd.
</p>

<p>
Another and another Tantor wrenched from the body of the ape-man,
throwing them to right and to left, where they lay either moaning or
very quiet, as death came slowly or at once.
</p>

<p>
At a distance Mbonga rallied his warriors.  His greedy eyes had noted
the great ivory tusks of the bull.  The first panic of terror relieved,
he urged his men forward to attack with their heavy elephant spears;
but as they came, Tantor swung Tarzan to his broad head, and, wheeling,
lumbered off into the jungle through the great rent he had made in the
palisade.
</p>

<p>
Elephant hunters may be right when they aver that this animal would not
have rendered such service to a man, but to Tantor, Tarzan was not a
man—he was but a fellow jungle beast.
</p>

<p>
And so it was that Tantor, the elephant, discharged an obligation to
Tarzan of the Apes, cementing even more closely the friendship that had
existed between them since Tarzan as a little, brown boy rode upon
Tantor's huge back through the moonlit jungle beneath the equatorial
stars.

<h3 align="center">
The Fight for the Balu
</h3>

<p>
TEEKA HAD BECOME a mother.  Tarzan of the Apes was intensely
interested, much more so, in fact, than Taug, the father.  Tarzan was
very fond of Teeka.  Even the cares of prospective motherhood had not
entirely quenched the fires of carefree youth, and Teeka had remained a
good-natured playmate even at an age when other shes of the tribe of
Kerchak had assumed the sullen dignity of maturity.  She yet retained
her childish delight in the primitive games of tag and hide-and-go-seek
which Tarzan's fertile man-mind had evolved.
</p>

<p>
To play tag through the tree tops is an exciting and inspiring pastime.
Tarzan delighted in it, but the bulls of his childhood had long since
abandoned such childish practices.  Teeka, though, had been keen for it
always until shortly before the baby came; but with the advent of her
first-born, even Teeka changed.
</p>

<p>
The evidence of the change surprised and hurt Tarzan immeasurably.  One
morning he saw Teeka squatted upon a low branch hugging something very
close to her hairy breast—a wee something which squirmed and wriggled.
Tarzan approached filled with the curiosity which is common to all
creatures endowed with brains which have progressed beyond the
microscopic stage.
</p>

<p>
Teeka rolled her eyes in his direction and strained the squirming mite
still closer to her.  Tarzan came nearer.  Teeka drew away and bared
her fangs.  Tarzan was nonplussed.  In all his experiences with Teeka,
never before had she bared fangs at him other than in play; but today
she did not look playful.  Tarzan ran his brown fingers through his
thick, black hair, cocked his head upon one side, and stared.  Then he
edged a bit nearer, craning his neck to have a better look at the thing
which Teeka cuddled.
</p>

<p>
Again Teeka drew back her upper lip in a warning snarl.  Tarzan reached
forth a hand, cautiously, to touch the thing which Teeka held, and
Teeka, with a hideous growl, turned suddenly upon him.  Her teeth sank
into the flesh of his forearm before the ape-man could snatch it away,
and she pursued him for a short distance as he retreated incontinently
through the trees; but Teeka, carrying her baby, could not overtake
him.  At a safe distance Tarzan stopped and turned to regard his
erstwhile play-fellow in unconcealed astonishment.  What had happened
to so alter the gentle Teeka? She had so covered the thing in her arms
that Tarzan had not yet been able to recognize it for what it was; but
now, as she turned from the pursuit of him, he saw it.  Through his
pain and chagrin he smiled, for Tarzan had seen young ape mothers
before.  In a few days she would be less suspicious.  Still Tarzan was
hurt; it was not right that Teeka, of all others, should fear him.
Why, not for the world would he harm her, or her balu, which is the ape
word for baby.
</p>

<p>
And now, above the pain of his injured arm and the hurt to his pride,
rose a still stronger desire to come close and inspect the new-born son
of Taug.  Possibly you will wonder that Tarzan of the Apes, mighty
fighter that he was, should have fled before the irritable attack of a
she, or that he should hesitate to return for the satisfaction of his
curiosity when with ease he might have vanquished the weakened mother
of the new-born cub; but you need not wonder.  Were you an ape, you
would know that only a bull in the throes of madness will turn upon a
female other than to gently chastise her, with the occasional exception
of the individual whom we find exemplified among our own kind, and who
delights in beating up his better half because she happens to be
smaller and weaker than he.
</p>

<p>
Tarzan again came toward the young mother—warily and with his line of
retreat safely open.  Again Teeka growled ferociously.  Tarzan
expostulated.
</p>

<p>
"Tarzan of the Apes will not harm Teeka's balu," he said.  "Let me see
it."
</p>

<p>
"Go away!" commanded Teeka.  "Go away, or I will kill you."
</p>

<p>
"Let me see it," urged Tarzan.
</p>

<p>
"Go away," reiterated the she-ape. "Here comes Taug.  He will make you
go away.  Taug will kill you.  This is Taug's balu."
</p>

<p>
A savage growl close behind him apprised Tarzan of the nearness of
Taug, and the fact that the bull had heard the warnings and threats of
his mate and was coming to her succor.
</p>

<p>
Now Taug, as well as Teeka, had been Tarzan's play-fellow while the
bull was still young enough to wish to play.  Once Tarzan had saved
Taug's life; but the memory of an ape is not overlong, nor would
gratitude rise above the parental instinct.  Tarzan and Taug had once
measured strength, and Tarzan had been victorious.  That fact Taug
could be depended upon still to remember; but even so, he might readily
face another defeat for his first-born—if he chanced to be in the
proper mood.
</p>

<p>
From his hideous growls, which now rose in strength and volume, he
seemed to be in quite the mood.  Now Tarzan felt no fear of Taug, nor
did the unwritten law of the jungle demand that he should flee from
battle with any male, unless he cared to from purely personal reasons.
But Tarzan liked Taug.  He had no grudge against him, and his man-mind
told him what the mind of an ape would never have deduced—that Taug's
attitude in no sense indicated hatred.  It was but the instinctive urge
of the male to protect its offspring and its mate.
</p>

<p>
Tarzan had no desire to battle with Taug, nor did the blood of his
English ancestors relish the thought of flight, yet when the bull
charged, Tarzan leaped nimbly to one side, and thus encouraged, Taug
wheeled and rushed again madly to the attack.  Perhaps the memory of a
past defeat at Tarzan's hands goaded him.  Perhaps the fact that Teeka
sat there watching him aroused a desire to vanquish the ape-man before
her eyes, for in the breast of every jungle male lurks a vast egotism
which finds expression in the performance of deeds of derring-do before
an audience of the opposite sex.
</p>

<p>
At the ape-man's side swung his long grass rope—the play-thing of
yesterday, the weapon of today—and as Taug charged the second time,
Tarzan slipped the coils over his head and deftly shook out the sliding
noose as he again nimbly eluded the ungainly beast.  Before the ape
could turn again, Tarzan had fled far aloft among the branches of the
upper terrace.
</p>

<p>
Taug, now wrought to a frenzy of real rage, followed him.  Teeka peered
upward at them.  It was difficult to say whether she was interested.
Taug could not climb as rapidly as Tarzan, so the latter reached the
high levels to which the heavy ape dared not follow before the former
overtook him.  There he halted and looked down upon his pursuer, making
faces at him and calling him such choice names as occurred to the
fertile man-brain. Then, when he had worked Taug to such a pitch of
foaming rage that the great bull fairly danced upon the bending limb
beneath him, Tarzan's hand shot suddenly outward, a widening noose
dropped swiftly through the air, there was a quick jerk as it settled
about Taug, falling to his knees, a jerk that tightened it securely
about the hairy legs of the anthropoid.
</p>

<p>
Taug, slow of wit, realized too late the intention of his tormentor.
He scrambled to escape, but the ape-man gave the rope a tremendous jerk
that pulled Taug from his perch, and a moment later, growling
hideously, the ape hung head downward thirty feet above the ground.
</p>

<p>
Tarzan secured the rope to a stout limb and descended to a point close
to Taug.
</p>

<p>
"Taug," he said, "you are as stupid as Buto, the rhinoceros.  Now you
may hang here until you get a little sense in your thick head.  You may
hang here and watch while I go and talk with Teeka."
</p>

<p>
Taug blustered and threatened, but Tarzan only grinned at him as he
dropped lightly to the lower levels.  Here he again approached Teeka
only to be again greeted with bared fangs and menacing growls.  He
sought to placate her; he urged his friendly intentions, and craned his
neck to have a look at Teeka's balu; but the she-ape was not to be
persuaded that he meant other than harm to her little one.  Her
motherhood was still so new that reason was yet subservient to instinct.
</p>

<p>
Realizing the futility of attempting to catch and chastise Tarzan,
Teeka sought to escape him.  She dropped to the ground and lumbered
across the little clearing about which the apes of the tribe were
disposed in rest or in the search of food, and presently Tarzan
abandoned his attempts to persuade her to permit a close examination of
the balu.  The ape-man would have liked to handle the tiny thing.  The
very sight of it awakened in his breast a strange yearning.  He wished
to cuddle and fondle the grotesque little ape-thing. It was Teeka's
balu and Tarzan had once lavished his young affections upon Teeka.
</p>

<p>
But now his attention was diverted by the voice of Taug.  The threats
that had filled the ape's mouth had turned to pleas.  The tightening
noose was stopping the circulation of the blood in his legs—he was
beginning to suffer.  Several apes sat near him highly interested in
his predicament.  They made uncomplimentary remarks about him, for each
of them had felt the weight of Taug's mighty hands and the strength of
his great jaws.  They were enjoying revenge.
</p>

<p>
Teeka, seeing that Tarzan had turned back toward the trees, had halted
in the center of the clearing, and there she sat hugging her balu and
casting suspicious glances here and there.  With the coming of the
balu, Teeka's care-free world had suddenly become peopled with
innumerable enemies.  She saw an implacable foe in Tarzan, always
heretofore her best friend.  Even poor old Mumga, half blind and almost
entirely toothless, searching patiently for grubworms beneath a fallen
log, represented to her a malignant spirit thirsting for the blood of
little balus.
</p>

<p>
And while Teeka guarded suspiciously against harm, where there was no
harm, she failed to note two baleful, yellow-green eyes staring fixedly
at her from behind a clump of bushes at the opposite side of the
clearing.
</p>

<p>
Hollow from hunger, Sheeta, the panther, glared greedily at the
tempting meat so close at hand, but the sight of the great bulls beyond
gave him pause.
</p>

<p>
Ah, if the she-ape with her balu would but come just a trifle nearer! A
quick spring and he would be upon them and away again with his meat
before the bulls could prevent.
</p>

<p>
The tip of his tawny tail moved in spasmodic little jerks; his lower
jaw hung low, exposing a red tongue and yellow fangs.  But all this
Teeka did not see, nor did any other of the apes who were feeding or
resting about her.  Nor did Tarzan or the apes in the trees.
</p>

<p>
Hearing the abuse which the bulls were pouring upon the helpless Taug,
Tarzan clambered quickly among them.  One was edging closer and leaning
far out in an effort to reach the dangling ape.  He had worked himself
into quite a fury through recollection of the last occasion upon which
Taug had mauled him, and now he was bent upon revenge.  Once he had
grasped the swinging ape, he would quickly have drawn him within reach
of his jaws.  Tarzan saw and was wroth.  He loved a fair fight, but the
thing which this ape contemplated revolted him.  Already a hairy hand
had clutched the helpless Taug when, with an angry growl of protest,
Tarzan leaped to the branch at the attacking ape's side, and with a
single mighty cuff, swept him from his perch.
</p>

<p>
Surprised and enraged, the bull clutched madly for support as he
toppled sidewise, and then with an agile movement succeeded in
projecting himself toward another limb a few feet below.  Here he found
a hand-hold, quickly righted himself, and as quickly clambered upward
to be revenged upon Tarzan, but the ape-man was otherwise engaged and
did not wish to be interrupted.  He was explaining again to Taug the
depths of the latter's abysmal ignorance, and pointing out how much
greater and mightier was Tarzan of the Apes than Taug or any other ape.
</p>

<p>
In the end he would release Taug, but not until Taug was fully
acquainted with his own inferiority.  And then the maddened bull came
from beneath, and instantly Tarzan was transformed from a good-natured,
teasing youth into a snarling, savage beast.  Along his scalp the hair
bristled: his upper lip drew back that his fighting fangs might be
uncovered and ready.  He did not wait for the bull to reach him, for
something in the appearance or the voice of the attacker aroused within
the ape-man a feeling of belligerent antagonism that would not be
denied.  With a scream that carried no human note, Tarzan leaped
straight at the throat of the attacker.
</p>

<p>
The impetuosity of this act and the weight and momentum of his body
carried the bull backward, clutching and clawing for support, down
through the leafy branches of the tree.  For fifteen feet the two fell,
Tarzan's teeth buried in the jugular of his opponent, when a stout
branch stopped their descent.  The bull struck full upon the small of
his back across the limb, hung there for a moment with the ape-man
still upon his breast, and then toppled over toward the ground.
</p>

<p>
Tarzan had felt the instantaneous relaxation of the body beneath him
after the heavy impact with the tree limb, and as the other turned
completely over and started again upon its fall toward the ground, he
reached forth a hand and caught the branch in time to stay his own
descent, while the ape dropped like a plummet to the foot of the tree.
</p>

<p>
Tarzan looked downward for a moment upon the still form of his late
antagonist, then he rose to his full height, swelled his deep chest,
smote upon it with his clenched fist and roared out the uncanny
challenge of the victorious bull ape.
</p>

<p>
Even Sheeta, the panther, crouched for a spring at the edge of the
little clearing, moved uneasily as the mighty voice sent its weird cry
reverberating through the jungle.  To right and left, nervously,
glanced Sheeta, as though assuring himself that the way of escape lay
ready at hand.
</p>

<p>
"I am Tarzan of the Apes," boasted the ape-man; "mighty hunter, mighty
fighter! None in all the jungle so great as Tarzan."
</p>

<p>
Then he made his way back in the direction of Taug.  Teeka had watched
the happenings in the tree.  She had even placed her precious balu upon
the soft grasses and come a little nearer that she might better witness
all that was passing in the branches above her.  In her heart of hearts
did she still esteem the smooth-skinned Tarzan?  Did her savage breast
swell with pride as she witnessed his victory over the ape? You will
have to ask Teeka.
</p>

<p>
And Sheeta, the panther, saw that the she-ape had left her cub alone
among the grasses.  He moved his tail again, as though this closest
approximation of lashing in which he dared indulge might stimulate his
momentarily waned courage.  The cry of the victorious ape-man still
held his nerves beneath its spell.  It would be several minutes before
he again could bring himself to the point of charging into view of the
giant anthropoids.
</p>

<p>
And as he regathered his forces, Tarzan reached Taug's side, and then
clambering higher up to the point where the end of the grass rope was
made fast, he unloosed it and lowered the ape slowly downward, swinging
him in until the clutching hands fastened upon a limb.
</p>

<p>
Quickly Taug drew himself to a position of safety and shook off the
noose.  In his rage-maddened heart was no room for gratitude to the
ape-man. He recalled only the fact that Tarzan had laid this painful
indignity upon him.  He would be revenged, but just at present his legs
were so numb and his head so dizzy that he must postpone the
gratification of his vengeance.
</p>

<p>
Tarzan was coiling his rope the while he lectured Taug on the futility
of pitting his poor powers, physical and intellectual, against those of
his betters.  Teeka had come close beneath the tree and was peering
upward.  Sheeta was worming his way stealthily forward, his belly close
to the ground.  In another moment he would be clear of the underbrush
and ready for the rapid charge and the quick retreat that would end the
brief existence of Teeka's balu.
</p>

<p>
Then Tarzan chanced to look up and across the clearing.  Instantly his
attitude of good-natured bantering and pompous boastfulness dropped
from him.  Silently and swiftly he shot downward toward the ground.
Teeka, seeing him coming, and thinking that he was after her or her
balu, bristled and prepared to fight.  But Tarzan sped by her, and as
he went, her eyes followed him and she saw the cause of his sudden
descent and his rapid charge across the clearing.  There in full sight
now was Sheeta, the panther, stalking slowly toward the tiny, wriggling
balu which lay among the grasses many yards away.
</p>

<p>
Teeka gave voice to a shrill scream of terror and of warning as she
dashed after the ape-man. Sheeta saw Tarzan coming.  He saw the
she-ape's cub before him, and he thought that this other was bent upon
robbing him of his prey.  With an angry growl, he charged.
</p>

<p>
Taug, warned by Teeka's cry, came lumbering down to her assistance.
Several other bulls, growling and barking, closed in toward the
clearing, but they were all much farther from the balu and the panther
than was Tarzan of the Apes, so it was that Sheeta and the ape-man
reached Teeka's little one almost simultaneously; and there they stood,
one upon either side of it, baring their fangs and snarling at each
other over the little creature.
</p>

<p>
Sheeta was afraid to seize the balu, for thus he would give the ape-man
an opening for attack; and for the same reason Tarzan hesitated to
snatch the panther's prey out of harm's way, for had he stooped to
accomplish this, the great beast would have been upon him in an
instant.  Thus they stood while Teeka came across the clearing, going
more slowly as she neared the panther, for even her mother love could
scarce overcome her instinctive terror of this natural enemy of her
kind.
</p>

<p>
Behind her came Taug, warily and with many pauses and much bluster, and
still behind him came other bulls, snarling ferociously and uttering
their uncanny challenges.  Sheeta's yellow-green eyes glared terribly
at Tarzan, and past Tarzan they shot brief glances at the apes of
Kerchak advancing upon him.  Discretion prompted him to turn and flee,
but hunger and the close proximity of the tempting morsel in the grass
before him urged him to remain.  He reached forth a paw toward Teeka's
balu, and as he did so, with a savage guttural, Tarzan of the Apes was
upon him.
</p>

<p>
The panther reared to meet the ape-man's attack.  He swung a frightful
raking blow for Tarzan that would have wiped his face away had it
landed, but it did not land, for Tarzan ducked beneath it and closed,
his long knife ready in one strong hand—the knife of his dead father,
of the father he never had known.
</p>

<p>
Instantly the balu was forgotten by Sheeta, the panther.  He now
thought only of tearing to ribbons with his powerful talons the flesh
of his antagonist, of burying his long, yellow fangs in the soft,
smooth hide of the ape-man, but Tarzan had fought before with clawed
creatures of the jungle.  Before now he had battled with fanged
monsters, nor always had he come away unscathed.  He knew the risk that
he ran, but Tarzan of the Apes, inured to the sight of suffering and
death, shrank from neither, for he feared neither.
</p>

<p>
The instant that he dodged beneath Sheeta's blow, he leaped to the
beast's rear and then full upon the tawny back, burying his teeth in
Sheeta's neck and the fingers of one hand in the fur at the throat, and
with the other hand he drove his blade into Sheeta's side.
</p>

<p>
Over and over upon the grass rolled Sheeta, growling and screaming,
clawing and biting, in a mad effort to dislodge his antagonist or get
some portion of his body within range of teeth or talons.
</p>

<p>
As Tarzan leaped to close quarters with the panther, Teeka had run
quickly in and snatched up her balu.  Now she sat upon a high branch,
safe out of harm's way, cuddling the little thing close to her hairy
breast, the while her savage little eyes bored down upon the
contestants in the clearing, and her ferocious voice urged Taug and the
other bulls to leap into the melee.
</p>

<p>
Thus goaded the bulls came closer, redoubling their hideous clamor; but
Sheeta was already sufficiently engaged—he did not even hear them.
Once he succeeded in partially dislodging the ape-man from his back, so
that Tarzan swung for an instant in front of those awful talons, and in
the brief instant before he could regain his former hold, a raking blow
from a hind paw laid open one leg from hip to knee.
</p>

<br>

<p>
It was the sight and smell of this blood, possibly, which wrought upon
the encircling apes; but it was Taug who really was responsible for the
thing they did.
</p>

<p>
Taug, but a moment before filled with rage toward Tarzan of the Apes,
stood close to the battling pair, his red-rimmed, wicked little eyes
glaring at them.  What was passing in his savage brain? Did he gloat
over the unenviable position of his recent tormentor? Did he long to
see Sheeta's great fangs sink into the soft throat of the ape-man? Or
did he realize the courageous unselfishness that had prompted Tarzan to
rush to the rescue and imperil his life for Teeka's balu—for Taug's
little balu? Is gratitude a possession of man only, or do the lower
orders know it also?
</p>

<p>
With the spilling of Tarzan's blood, Taug answered these questions.
With all the weight of his great body he leaped, hideously growling,
upon Sheeta.  His long fighting fangs buried themselves in the white
throat.  His powerful arms beat and clawed at the soft fur until it
flew upward in the jungle breeze.
</p>

<p>
And with Taug's example before them the other bulls charged, burying
Sheeta beneath rending fangs and filling all the forest with the wild
din of their battle cries.
</p>

<p>
Ah! but it was a wondrous and inspiring sight—this battle of the
primordial apes and the great, white ape-man with their ancestral foe,
Sheeta, the panther.
</p>

<p>
In frenzied excitement, Teeka fairly danced upon the limb which swayed
beneath her great weight as she urged on the males of her people, and
Thaka, and Mumga, and Kamma, with the other shes of the tribe of
Kerchak, added their shrill cries or fierce barkings to the pandemonium
which now reigned within the jungle.
</p>

<p>
Bitten and biting, tearing and torn, Sheeta battled for his life; but
the odds were against him.  Even Numa, the lion, would have hesitated
to have attacked an equal number of the great bulls of the tribe of
Kerchak, and now, a half mile away, hearing the sounds of the terrific
battle, the king of beasts rose uneasily from his midday slumber and
slunk off farther into the jungle.
</p>

<p>
Presently Sheeta's torn and bloody body ceased its titanic struggles.
It stiffened spasmodically, twitched and was still, yet the bulls
continued to lacerate it until the beautiful coat was torn to shreds.
At last they desisted from sheer physical weariness, and then from the
tangle of bloody bodies rose a crimson giant, straight as an arrow.
</p>

<p>
He placed a foot upon the dead body of the panther, and lifting his
blood-stained face to the blue of the equatorial heavens, gave voice to
the horrid victory cry of the bull ape.
</p>

<p>
One by one his hairy fellows of the tribe of Kerchak followed his
example.  The shes came down from their perches of safety and struck
and reviled the dead body of Sheeta.  The young apes refought the
battle in mimicry of their mighty elders.
</p>

<p>
Teeka was quite close to Tarzan.  He turned and saw her with the balu
hugged close to her hairy breast, and put out his hands to take the
little one, expecting that Teeka would bare her fangs and spring upon
him; but instead she placed the balu in his arms, and coming nearer,
licked his frightful wounds.
</p>

<p>
And presently Taug, who had escaped with only a few scratches, came and
squatted beside Tarzan and watched him as he played with the little
balu, and at last he too leaned over and helped Teeka with the
cleansing and the healing of the ape-man's hurts.

The God of Tarzan
</h3>

<p>
AMONG THE BOOKS of his dead father in the little cabin by the
land-locked harbor, Tarzan of the Apes found many things to puzzle his
young head.  By much labor and through the medium of infinite patience
as well, he had, without assistance, discovered the purpose of the
little bugs which ran riot upon the printed pages.  He had learned that
in the many combinations in which he found them they spoke in a silent
language, spoke in a strange tongue, spoke of wonderful things which a
little ape-boy could not by any chance fully understand, arousing his
curiosity, stimulating his imagination and filling his soul with a
mighty longing for further knowledge.
</p>

<p>
A dictionary had proven itself a wonderful storehouse of information,
when, after several years of tireless endeavor, he had solved the
mystery of its purpose and the manner of its use.  He had learned to
make a species of game out of it, following up the spoor of a new
thought through the mazes of the many definitions which each new word
required him to consult.  It was like following a quarry through the
jungle—it was hunting, and Tarzan of the Apes was an indefatigable
huntsman.
</p>

<p>
There were, of course, certain words which aroused his curiosity to a
greater extent than others, words which, for one reason or another,
excited his imagination.  There was one, for example, the meaning of
which was rather difficult to grasp.  It was the word GOD.  Tarzan
first had been attracted to it by the fact that it was very short and
that it commenced with a larger g-bug than those about it—a male g-bug
it was to Tarzan, the lower-case letters being females.  Another fact
which attracted him to this word was the number of he-bugs which
figured in its definition—Supreme Deity, Creator or Upholder of the
Universe.  This must be a very important word indeed, he would have to
look into it, and he did, though it still baffled him after many months
of thought and study.
</p>

<p>
However, Tarzan counted no time wasted which he devoted to these
strange hunting expeditions into the game preserves of knowledge, for
each word and each definition led on and on into strange places, into
new worlds where, with increasing frequency, he met old, familiar
faces.  And always he added to his store of knowledge.
</p>

<p>
But of the meaning of GOD he was yet in doubt.  Once he thought he had
grasped it—that God was a mighty chieftain, king of all the Mangani.
He was not quite sure, however, since that would mean that God was
mightier than Tarzan—a point which Tarzan of the Apes, who
acknowledged no equal in the jungle, was loath to concede.
</p>

<p>
But in all the books he had there was no picture of God, though he
found much to confirm his belief that God was a great, an all-powerful
individual.  He saw pictures of places where God was worshiped; but
never any sign of God.  Finally he began to wonder if God were not of a
different form than he, and at last he determined to set out in search
of Him.
</p>

<p>
He commenced by questioning Mumga, who was very old and had seen many
strange things in her long life; but Mumga, being an ape, had a faculty
for recalling the trivial.  That time when Gunto mistook a sting-bug
for an edible beetle had made more impression upon Mumga than all the
innumerable manifestations of the greatness of God which she had
witnessed, and which, of course, she had not understood.
</p>

<p>
Numgo, overhearing Tarzan's questions, managed to wrest his attention
long enough from the diversion of flea hunting to advance the theory
that the power which made the lightning and the rain and the thunder
came from Goro, the moon.  He knew this, he said, because the Dum-Dum
always was danced in the light of Goro.  This reasoning, though
entirely satisfactory to Numgo and Mumga, failed fully to convince
Tarzan.  However, it gave him a basis for further investigation along a
new line.  He would investigate the moon.
</p>

<p>
That night he clambered to the loftiest pinnacle of the tallest jungle
giant.  The moon was full, a great, glorious, equatorial moon.  The
ape-man, upright upon a slender, swaying limb, raised his bronzed face
to the silver orb.  Now that he had clambered to the highest point
within his reach, he discovered, to his surprise, that Goro was as far
away as when he viewed him from the ground.  He thought that Goro was
attempting to elude him.
</p>

<p>
"Come, Goro!" he cried, "Tarzan of the Apes will not harm you!" But
still the moon held aloof.
</p>

<p>
"Tell me," he continued, "if you be the great king who sends Ara, the
lightning; who makes the great noise and the mighty winds, and sends
the waters down upon the jungle people when the days are dark and it is
cold.  Tell me, Goro, are you God?"
</p>

<p>
Of course he did not pronounce God as you or I would pronounce His
name, for Tarzan knew naught of the spoken language of his English
forbears; but he had a name of his own invention for each of the little
bugs which constituted the alphabet.  Unlike the apes he was not
satisfied merely to have a mental picture of the things he knew, he
must have a word descriptive of each.  In reading he grasped a word in
its entirety; but when he spoke the words he had learned from the books
of his father, he pronounced each according to the names he had given
the various little bugs which occurred in it, usually giving the gender
prefix for each.
</p>

<p>
Thus it was an imposing word which Tarzan made of GOD.  The masculine
prefix of the apes is BU, the feminine MU; g Tarzan had named LA, o he
pronounced TU, and d was MO. So the word God evolved itself into
BULAMUTUMUMO, or, in English, he-g-she-o-she-d.
</p>

<p>
Similarly he had arrived at a strange and wonderful spelling of his own
name.  Tarzan is derived from the two ape words TAR and ZAN, meaning
white skin.  It was given him by his foster mother, Kala, the great
she-ape. When Tarzan first put it into the written language of his own
people he had not yet chanced upon either WHITE or SKIN in the
dictionary; but in a primer he had seen the picture of a little white
boy and so he wrote his name BUMUDE-MUTOMURO, or he-boy.
</p>

<p>
To follow Tarzan's strange system of spelling would be laborious as
well as futile, and so we shall in the future, as we have in the past,
adhere to the more familiar forms of our grammar school copybooks.  It
would tire you to remember that DO meant b, TU o, and RO y, and that to
say he-boy you must prefix the ape masculine gender sound BU before the
entire word and the feminine gender sound MU before each of the
lower-case letters which go to make up boy—it would tire you and it
would bring me to the nineteenth hole several strokes under par.
</p>

<p>
And so Tarzan harangued the moon, and when Goro did not reply, Tarzan
of the Apes waxed wroth.  He swelled his giant chest and bared his
fighting fangs, and hurled into the teeth of the dead satellite the
challenge of the bull ape.
</p>

<p>
"You are not Bulamutumumo," he cried.  "You are not king of the jungle
folk.  You are not so great as Tarzan, mighty fighter, mighty hunter.
None there is so great as Tarzan.  If there be a Bulamutumumo, Tarzan
can kill him.  Come down, Goro, great coward, and fight with Tarzan.
Tarzan will kill you.  I am Tarzan, the killer."
</p>

<p>
But the moon made no answer to the boasting of the ape-man, and when a
cloud came and obscured her face, Tarzan thought that Goro was indeed
afraid, and was hiding from him, so he came down out of the trees and
awoke Numgo and told him how great was Tarzan—how he had frightened
Goro out of the sky and made him tremble.  Tarzan spoke of the moon as
HE, for all things large or awe inspiring are male to the ape folk.
</p>

<p>
Numgo was not much impressed; but he was very sleepy, so he told Tarzan
to go away and leave his betters alone.
</p>

<p>
"But where shall I find God?" insisted Tarzan.  "You are very old; if
there is a God you must have seen Him.  What does He look like? Where
does He live?"
</p>

<p>
"I am God," replied Numgo.  "Now sleep and disturb me no more."
</p>

<p>
Tarzan looked at Numgo steadily for several minutes, his shapely head
sank just a trifle between his great shoulders, his square chin shot
forward and his short upper lip drew back, exposing his white teeth.
Then, with a low growl he leaped upon the ape and buried his fangs in
the other's hairy shoulder, clutching the great neck in his mighty
fingers.  Twice he shook the old ape, then he released his tooth-hold.
</p>

<p>
"Are you God?" he demanded.
</p>

<p>
"No," wailed Numgo.  "I am only a poor, old ape.  Leave me alone.  Go
ask the Gomangani where God is.  They are hairless like yourself and
very wise, too.  They should know."
</p>

<p>
Tarzan released Numgo and turned away.  The suggestion that he consult
the blacks appealed to him, and though his relations with the people of
Mbonga, the chief, were the antithesis of friendly, he could at least
spy upon his hated enemies and discover if they had intercourse with
God.
</p>

<p>
So it was that Tarzan set forth through the trees toward the village of
the blacks, all excitement at the prospect of discovering the Supreme
Being, the Creator of all things.  As he traveled he reviewed,
mentally, his armament—the condition of his hunting knife, the number
of his arrows, the newness of the gut which strung his bow—he hefted
the war spear which had once been the pride of some black warrior of
Mbonga's tribe.
</p>

<p>
If he met God, Tarzan would be prepared.  One could never tell whether
a grass rope, a war spear, or a poisoned arrow would be most
efficacious against an unfamiliar foe.  Tarzan of the Apes was quite
content—if God wished to fight, the ape-man had no doubt as to the
outcome of the struggle.  There were many questions Tarzan wished to
put to the Creator of the Universe and so he hoped that God would not
prove a belligerent God; but his experience of life and the ways of
living things had taught him that any creature with the means for
offense and defense was quite likely to provoke attack if in the proper
mood.
</p>

<p>
It was dark when Tarzan came to the village of Mbonga.  As silently as
the silent shadows of the night he sought his accustomed place among
the branches of the great tree which overhung the palisade.  Below him,
in the village street, he saw men and women.  The men were hideously
painted—more hideously than usual.  Among them moved a weird and
grotesque figure, a tall figure that went upon the two legs of a man
and yet had the head of a buffalo.  A tail dangled to his ankles behind
him, and in one hand he carried a zebra's tail while the other clutched
a bunch of small arrows.
</p>

<p>
Tarzan was electrified.  Could it be that chance had given him thus
early an opportunity to look upon God? Surely this thing was neither
man nor beast, so what could it be then other than the Creator of the
Universe! The ape-man watched the every move of the strange creature.
He saw the black men and women fall back at its approach as though they
stood in terror of its mysterious powers.
</p>

<p>
Presently he discovered that the deity was speaking and that all
listened in silence to his words.  Tarzan was sure that none other than
God could inspire such awe in the hearts of the Gomangani, or stop
their mouths so effectually without recourse to arrows or spears.
Tarzan had come to look with contempt upon the blacks, principally
because of their garrulity.  The small apes talked a great deal and ran
away from an enemy.  The big, old bulls of Kerchak talked but little
and fought upon the slightest provocation.  Numa, the lion, was not
given to loquacity, yet of all the jungle folk there were few who
fought more often than he.
</p>

<p>
Tarzan witnessed strange things that night, none of which he
understood, and, perhaps because they were strange, he thought that
they must have to do with the God he could not understand.  He saw
three youths receive their first war spears in a weird ceremony which
the grotesque witch-doctor strove successfully to render uncanny and
awesome.
</p>

<p>
Hugely interested, he watched the slashing of the three brown arms and
the exchange of blood with Mbonga, the chief, in the rites of the
ceremony of blood brotherhood.  He saw the zebra's tail dipped into a
caldron of water above which the witch-doctor had made magical passes
the while he danced and leaped about it, and he saw the breasts and
foreheads of each of the three novitiates sprinkled with the charmed
liquid.  Could the ape-man have known the purpose of this act, that it
was intended to render the recipient invulnerable to the attacks of his
enemies and fearless in the face of any danger, he would doubtless have
leaped into the village street and appropriated the zebra's tail and a
portion of the contents of the caldron.
</p>

<p>
But he did not know, and so he only wondered, not alone at what he saw
but at the strange sensations which played up and down his naked spine,
sensations induced, doubtless, by the same hypnotic influence which
held the black spectators in tense awe upon the verge of a hysteric
upheaval.
</p>

<p>
The longer Tarzan watched, the more convinced he became that his eyes
were upon God, and with the conviction came determination to have word
with the deity.  With Tarzan of the Apes, to think was to act.
</p>

<p>
The people of Mbonga were keyed to the highest pitch of hysterical
excitement.  They needed little to release the accumulated pressure of
static nerve force which the terrorizing mummery of the witch-doctor
had induced.
</p>

<p>
A lion roared, suddenly and loud, close without the palisade.  The
blacks started nervously, dropping into utter silence as they listened
for a repetition of that all-too-familiar and always terrorizing voice.
Even the witch-doctor paused in the midst of an intricate step,
remaining momentarily rigid and statuesque as he plumbed his cunning
mind for a suggestion as how best he might take advantage of the
condition of his audience and the timely interruption.
</p>

<p>
Already the evening had been vastly profitable to him.  There would be
three goats for the initiation of the three youths into full-fledged
warriorship, and besides these he had received several gifts of grain
and beads, together with a piece of copper wire from admiring and
terrified members of his audience.
</p>

<p>
Numa's roar still reverberated along taut nerves when a woman's laugh,
shrill and piercing, shattered the silence of the village.  It was this
moment that Tarzan chose to drop lightly from his tree into the village
street.  Fearless among his blood enemies he stood, taller by a full
head than many of Mbonga's warriors, straight as their straightest
arrow, muscled like Numa, the lion.
</p>

<p>
For a moment Tarzan stood looking straight at the witch-doctor. Every
eye was upon him, yet no one had moved—a paralysis of terror held
them, to be broken a moment later as the ape-man, with a toss of head,
stepped straight toward the hideous figure beneath the buffalo head.
</p>

<p>
Then the nerves of the blacks could stand no more.  For months the
terror of the strange, white, jungle god had been upon them.  Their
arrows had been stolen from the very center of the village; their
warriors had been silently slain upon the jungle trails and their dead
bodies dropped mysteriously and by night into the village street as
from the heavens above.
</p>

<p>
One or two there were who had glimpsed the strange figure of the new
demon and it was from their oft-repeated descriptions that the entire
village now recognized Tarzan as the author of many of their ills.
Upon another occasion and by daylight, the warriors would doubtless
have leaped to attack him, but at night, and this night of all others,
when they were wrought to such a pitch of nervous dread by the uncanny
artistry of their witch-doctor, they were helpless with terror.  As one
man they turned and fled, scattering for their huts, as Tarzan
advanced.  For a moment one and one only held his ground.  It was the
witch-doctor. More than half self-hypnotized into a belief in his own
charlatanry he faced this new demon who threatened to undermine his
ancient and lucrative profession.
</p>

<br>

<p>
"Are you God?" asked Tarzan.
</p>

<p>
The witch-doctor, having no idea of the meaning of the other's words,
danced a few strange steps, leaped high in the air, turning completely
around and alighting in a stooping posture with feet far outspread and
head thrust out toward the ape-man. Thus he remained for an instant
before he uttered a loud "Boo!" which was evidently intended to
frighten Tarzan away; but in reality had no such effect.
</p>

<p>
Tarzan did not pause.  He had set out to approach and examine God and
nothing upon earth might now stay his feet.  Seeing that his antics had
no potency with the visitor, the witch-doctor tried some new medicine.
Spitting upon the zebra's tail, which he still clutched in one hand, he
made circles above it with the arrows in the other hand, meanwhile
backing cautiously away from Tarzan and speaking confidentially to the
bushy end of the tail.
</p>

<p>
This medicine must be short medicine, however, for the creature, god or
demon, was steadily closing up the distance which had separated them.
The circles therefore were few and rapid, and when they were completed,
the witch-doctor struck an attitude which was intended to be awe
inspiring and waving the zebra's tail before him, drew an imaginary
line between himself and Tarzan.
</p>

<p>
"Beyond this line you cannot pass, for my medicine is strong medicine,"
he cried.  "Stop, or you will fall dead as your foot touches this spot.
My mother was a voodoo, my father was a snake; I live upon lions'
hearts and the entrails of the panther; I eat young babies for
breakfast and the demons of the jungle are my slaves.  I am the most
powerful witch-doctor in the world; I fear nothing, for I cannot die.
I—" But he got no further; instead he turned and fled as Tarzan of the
Apes crossed the magical dead line and still lived.
</p>

<p>
As the witch-doctor ran, Tarzan almost lost his temper.  This was no
way for God to act, at least not in accordance with the conception
Tarzan had come to have of God.
</p>

<p>
"Come back!" he cried.  "Come back, God, I will not harm you." But the
witch-doctor was in full retreat by this time, stepping high as he
leaped over cooking pots and the smoldering embers of small fires that
had burned before the huts of villagers.  Straight for his own hut ran
the witch-doctor, terror-spurred to unwonted speed; but futile was his
effort—the ape-man bore down upon him with the speed of Bara, the deer.
</p>

<p>
Just at the entrance to his hut the witch-doctor was overhauled.  A
heavy hand fell upon his shoulder to drag him back.  It seized upon a
portion of the buffalo hide, dragging the disguise from him.  It was a
naked black man that Tarzan saw dodge into the darkness of the hut's
interior.
</p>

<p>
So this was what he had thought was God! Tarzan's lip curled in an
angry snarl as he leaped into the hut after the terror-stricken
witch-doctor. In the blackness within he found the man huddled at the
far side and dragged him forth into the comparative lightness of the
moonlit night.
</p>

<p>
The witch-doctor bit and scratched in an attempt to escape; but a few
cuffs across the head brought him to a better realization of the
futility of resistance.  Beneath the moon Tarzan held the cringing
figure upon its shaking feet.
</p>

<p>
"So you are God!" he cried.  "If you be God, then Tarzan is greater
than God," and so the ape-man thought.  "I am Tarzan," he shouted into
the ear of the black.  "In all the jungle, or above it, or upon the
running waters, or the sleeping waters, or upon the big water, or the
little water, there is none so great as Tarzan.  Tarzan is greater than
the Mangani; he is greater than the Gomangani.  With his own hands he
has slain Numa, the lion, and Sheeta, the panther; there is none so
great as Tarzan.  Tarzan is greater than God.  See!" and with a sudden
wrench he twisted the black's neck until the fellow shrieked in pain
and then slumped to the earth in a swoon.
</p>

<p>
Placing his foot upon the neck of the fallen witch-doctor, the ape-man
raised his face to the moon and uttered the long, shrill scream of the
victorious bull ape.  Then he stooped and snatched the zebra's tail
from the nerveless fingers of the unconscious man and without a
backward glance retraced his footsteps across the village.
</p>

<p>
From several hut doorways frightened eyes watched him.  Mbonga, the
chief, was one of those who had seen what passed before the hut of the
witch-doctor. Mbonga was greatly concerned.  Wise old patriarch that he
was, he never had more than half believed in witch-doctors, at least
not since greater wisdom had come with age; but as a chief he was well
convinced of the power of the witch-doctor as an arm of government, and
often it was that Mbonga used the superstitious fears of his people to
his own ends through the medium of the medicine-man.
